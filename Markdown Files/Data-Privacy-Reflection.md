## ✅ Commitment

One key habit I’ve adopted is to **verify the sensitivity of information before sharing it**, especially in collaborative tools like Google Docs or Slack. I also now **use a password manager** for all my credentials and **double-check file access permissions** before uploading or sharing documents.
