## üîç Research & Learn

### What are common cyber security threats in a remote work environment?
- Phishing attacks
- Malware and ransomware
- Insecure Wi-Fi networks
- Unpatched software vulnerabilities
- Unauthorized access due to weak passwords

### What are best practices for keeping your devices and accounts secure?
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Regularly update software and systems
- Lock your computer when not in use
- Use trusted antivirus and firewall protections

### Why is it important to lock your computer when away from your desk?
Locking prevents unauthorized access, ensuring that sensitive company data remains protected even if you step away briefly.

### How should you handle phishing attempts and suspicious links?
- Never click on unknown links.
- Report suspicious emails immediately.
- Verify the sender's identity through other trusted channels.

### What makes a strong password, and why should you use a password manager?
- A strong password includes a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters, and is at least 12 characters long.
- A password manager helps create and store complex passwords securely, avoiding password reuse and weak passwords.

### Why is two-factor authentication (2FA) important, and when should you enable it?
2FA adds an extra layer of security beyond just a password. You should enable it on all sensitive accounts, including work email, cloud services, and password managers.

## üìù Reflection

### What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?
I currently use strong passwords and lock my computer manually, but I can improve by using a dedicated password manager and enabling 2FA on all accounts.

### How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?
By setting up systems (like auto-lock, password managers, and reminders) that automate good habits, and by staying aware of security best practices.

### What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?
- Use a password manager to store complex, unique passwords.
- Enable 2FA for all critical accounts.
- Regularly review and update passwords.

### What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?
Immediately report it to Focus Bear's IT or management team, change all related passwords, and follow incident response protocols.
