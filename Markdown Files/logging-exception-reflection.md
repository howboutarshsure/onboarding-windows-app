# ü™µ Logging & Exception Handling Reflection ‚Äì C# Application

## üéØ Project Summary

In this task, I created a simple C# console application that performs a basic arithmetic operation (division). I integrated the **Serilog** logging framework to record runtime events and implemented structured exception handling to log errors when invalid inputs or unexpected runtime issues occur.

The application demonstrates how proper logging and error management improve both maintainability and user experience by preventing crashes and providing meaningful diagnostics.

### ‚úÖ Best Practices for Logging in C# Applications

- Use a structured logging framework like **Serilog**, **NLog**, or **log4net**
- Log to multiple outputs (e.g., console, file, database)
- Use log levels appropriately (Debug, Info, Warning, Error, Fatal)
- Avoid logging sensitive information
- Include context-rich data (timestamps, user IDs, etc.)

### ‚úÖ Exception Handling & Diagnostic Logging

- Catch specific exceptions (e.g., `DivideByZeroException`) before general ones
- Log detailed messages and stack traces using logging frameworks
- Always use `finally` or `using` blocks to clean up resources
- Use `try-catch` blocks around risky operations only (avoid overuse)

### ‚úÖ Patterns in Production Code

- Centralized logging (e.g., middleware in ASP.NET Core)
- Custom exception classes with relevant error codes/messages
- Correlation IDs for distributed tracing
- Retry logic and graceful fallback for transient failures

### ‚úÖ Logging Improves Troubleshooting and Quality

Logging provides real-time visibility into application behaviour. It speeds up troubleshooting by pinpointing when, where, and why issues occurred. It also encourages developers to write cleaner, more traceable code.

### ‚úÖ Exception Handling Builds Trust and Stability

Handled exceptions prevent crashes and reassure users with friendly messages. From a technical standpoint, logging unhandled exceptions gives developers insight into bugs that users might not report.

### ‚úÖ Strategies for Complex Applications

- Use structured logging for better querying and analysis
- Apply consistent logging standards across modules and teams
- Integrate with observability tools like Seq, Kibana, or Application Insights
- Automatically archive or rotate logs to manage file sizes
- Monitor logs in production to catch issues early

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

Integrating Serilog and implementing structured exception handling helped me understand the importance of observability and fault tolerance in software design. These practices are essential for building scalable, user-friendly, and maintainable C# applications.
