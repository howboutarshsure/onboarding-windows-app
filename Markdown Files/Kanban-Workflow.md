# Agile Workflows & Kanban

## 🔍 Research & Learn

### How does a Kanban board work, and how does it help manage workflow?

A Kanban board visualises tasks using columns and cards, helping teams manage work by showing the status of each task at a glance. It improves transparency, tracks progress, and helps identify bottlenecks.

### What do the different columns on a Kanban board represent?

- **Backlog**: Tasks that are planned but not started.
- **In Progress**: Tasks currently being worked on.
- **Blocked**: Tasks that are stuck or waiting on something.
- **Done**: Completed tasks.

### How do tasks move through the board, and who is responsible for updating them?

Tasks move left to right as work progresses. Team members are responsible for updating the task status as they work on them, typically after daily stand-ups or when they complete a step.

### What are the benefits of limiting work in progress (WIP)?

- Helps focus on fewer tasks at a time.
- Reduces context switching.
- Improves task completion rate.
- Makes bottlenecks more visible.

## 📝 Reflection

### How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?

Kanban makes it easy to see what’s important and what’s in progress. Limiting WIP ensures that no one is overloaded, and tasks are completed before new ones are started.

### How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?

By visually tracking tasks, limiting the number of simultaneous tasks, and reviewing progress regularly, I can focus better, complete work more efficiently, and stay organised.

## 🛠️ Task

- Reviewed Focus Bear’s Kanban board on GitHub Projects. Tasks are structured into clear columns with details and owners assigned.
- Moved one task from “In Progress” to “Done” after completing it and updated the notes accordingly.
- **One improvement**: Set personal WIP limits and regularly review the board to ensure tasks stay up to date and aligned with priorities.
