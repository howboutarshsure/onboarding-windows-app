# Module 1: Agile Principles & Frameworks

## üîç Research & Learn

### What is Agile, and how does it differ from traditional project management?

Agile is a flexible, iterative approach to software development that emphasises collaboration, customer feedback, and adaptive planning. Unlike traditional (waterfall) project management, which follows a linear and fixed plan, Agile allows for frequent adjustments and delivers value in smaller increments.

### What are the core values and principles of Agile?

From the Agile Manifesto:

**Core Values:**
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

**Key Principles:**
- Deliver working software frequently
- Welcome changing requirements
- Build projects around motivated individuals
- Face-to-face conversation is best (or its closest remote equivalent)
- Continuous attention to technical excellence
- Simplicity‚Äîthe art of maximizing the amount of work not done

### What are the differences between Scrum and Kanban, and when is each used?

- **Scrum** is time-boxed (sprints), with fixed roles and regular ceremonies like stand-ups and retrospectives.
- **Kanban** is flow-based, with no fixed timeframes. Tasks move continuously through stages.

**Use Scrum** when you need structured sprints and defined planning.  
**Use Kanban** when priorities shift often, and you want more flexibility in task flow.

### Why does Focus Bear lean towards Kanban instead of Scrum?

Focus Bear prefers Kanban because it allows continuous delivery, frequent updates, and flexibility in prioritising tasks. The team can adapt quickly without waiting for the end of a sprint, which suits a startup-style workflow.

## üìù Reflection

### What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?

**Benefits**:
- Better adaptability to change
- Faster delivery of features
- Continuous improvement and feedback

**Challenges**:
- Requires high team communication and collaboration
- Less predictability if priorities change frequently

### How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?

Agile encourages constant feedback and small, manageable improvements. This helps me, as a Windows Developer Intern, stay focused, adapt to changes easily, and regularly deliver meaningful updates to the app.

## üõ†Ô∏è Task

### Summary: Scrum vs. Kanban

Scrum uses set sprints, fixed roles, and ceremonies like stand-ups and retrospectives. Kanban is continuous, flexible, and visual, with tasks flowing through a board. Scrum is best for structured planning; Kanban is better for dynamic work.

### One Agile principle useful for my work

**‚ÄúWorking software is the primary measure of progress.‚Äù**  
This principle reminds me to focus on delivering functional features that users can interact with, rather than getting stuck in planning or perfection.
