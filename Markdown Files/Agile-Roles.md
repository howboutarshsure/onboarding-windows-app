# Roles in an Agile Team

## üîç Research & Learn

### What are the key roles in an Agile team, and what does each role do?

- **Developers**: Write and maintain code to deliver features and fix bugs. They build the product.
- **QA (Quality Assurance)**: Test the product to ensure it meets quality standards and works as expected.
- **Product Manager (PM)**: Defines product vision, prioritises features, and ensures customer needs are met.
- **Agile Project Manager (Agile PM)**: Facilitates Agile practices, removes blockers, and keeps the team aligned and productive.
- **Other supporting roles**:
  - **Stakeholders**: Provide input and feedback based on business needs.
  - **UX Designers**: Ensure the product is user-friendly and accessible.
  - **Customer Support**: Relay user feedback and help identify pain points or issues.

### How do these roles collaborate in Kanban vs. Scrum?

- In **Scrum**, roles are clearly defined, with regular ceremonies (like stand-ups, sprint planning, retrospectives) promoting collaboration.
- In **Kanban**, collaboration is more continuous and flow-based. Teams update and pull tasks as needed with less ceremony, focusing on visualising work and limiting WIP.

## üìù Reflection

### What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?

As a **Windows Developer Intern** at Focus Bear, I contribute by building and refining desktop application features. I help translate ideas and user needs into working code and ensure the app aligns with the team's goals.

### How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?

I frequently interact with QA to ensure features I build meet expected quality standards. I also coordinate with the PM for feature requirements and timelines, and sometimes consult with UX for design feedback.

## üõ†Ô∏è Task

### Description of my role in the Agile team

I am responsible for developing and maintaining the Windows version of the Focus Bear app. This involves working on new features, fixing bugs, and collaborating with team members to ensure my work integrates smoothly into the overall product.

### One role I frequently collaborate with and how to improve teamwork

I often work with **QA engineers** to test my code. To improve teamwork, I can write clearer commit messages and provide test notes for new features, making it easier for QA to understand what to verify.
