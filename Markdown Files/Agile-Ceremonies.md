# Agile Ceremonies & Team Collaboration

## üîç Research & Learn

### What are the main Agile ceremonies, and what is their purpose?

- **Daily Stand-ups**: Short daily meetings where team members share progress, plans, and blockers.
- **Sprint Planning (Scrum)**: Sets goals for the sprint and distributes work among the team.
- **Continuous Prioritization (Kanban)**: Tasks are continuously added and prioritized as work is completed.
- **Retrospectives**: Held at the end of a sprint to reflect on what went well and what can be improved.
- **Backlog Refinement**: Ongoing process of updating and clarifying backlog items to ensure they're ready for future work.

### How do Agile teams collaborate asynchronously and across time zones?

- Use tools like Slack, Jira, Trello, and Confluence to share progress and updates.
- Record meetings and demos so others can catch up later.
- Provide written updates instead of live stand-ups when needed.
- Set overlapping hours for critical collaboration.
- Document decisions and tasks clearly for visibility.

## üìù Reflection

### How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?

Agile ceremonies keep everyone informed, aligned on goals, and aware of issues. They create regular check-ins that promote accountability and transparency.

### Which ceremony do you think is most important for your role, and why?

For my role, **Daily Stand-ups** are most important. They provide quick visibility into everyone's progress and blockers, helping coordinate tasks efficiently, especially in a distributed team.

## üõ†Ô∏è Task

- Attended a stand-up meeting and observed that updates were shared in a structured format: yesterday‚Äôs work, today‚Äôs plan, and blockers.
- Participated in a retrospective and noted the importance of feedback and reflection for continuous improvement.
- **One change to improve team collaboration**: Start using shared documentation to track and summarise meetings, so that all members, regardless of time zone, can stay aligned.
