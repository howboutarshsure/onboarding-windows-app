# üß™ Testing Reflection ‚Äì WPF Application

## üéØ Project Overview

For this task, I created a simple WPF application that allows users to input a string and reverse it. The core logic was separated into a `TextProcessor` class, which made it easier to test independently from the UI.

I used **NUnit** as the testing framework to write and run unit tests, verifying the output of the `ReverseText()` method against various edge cases like empty strings and null values.

### ‚úÖ Differences Between Unit Testing and UI Testing

| Type         | Unit Testing                             | UI Testing                                            |
|--------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Scope        | Tests individual components (logic)      | Tests user interface interactions                    |
| Speed        | Fast execution                           | Slower (UI elements must render)                     |
| Stability    | More stable (UI changes don't affect it) | Fragile (UI layout or control name changes break it) |
| Tools        | NUnit, MSTest, xUnit                     | FlaUI, White, Appium, WinAppDriver                   |
| Focus        | ViewModels, services, helpers            | Buttons, navigation, user inputs                    |

### ‚úÖ Common Testing Frameworks & Tools

- **NUnit / MSTest / xUnit** ‚Äì for unit testing
- **FlaUI / WinAppDriver / White** ‚Äì for WPF UI automation
- **MVVM pattern** ‚Äì enables easy testing by isolating logic from UI

### ‚úÖ Designing Effective Tests

- Cover typical inputs (normal cases)
- Handle edge cases (null, empty, long strings)
- Test for invalid input behavior
- Write tests for methods in isolation (unit tests)
- Keep UI tests minimal and focus only on critical workflows

### ‚úÖ How Testing Improved My Development Process

Writing unit tests helped me focus on modular code, especially separating UI from logic. It allowed me to verify that the core functionality (string reversal) worked correctly, regardless of the UI. I could catch mistakes early and fix them without needing to run the full application.

### ‚úÖ Trade-offs: Unit Tests vs UI Tests

- **Unit tests** are easy to write, fast to run, and stable. They're ideal for business logic and ViewModel validation.
- **UI tests** simulate real user interactions but are harder to maintain and slower. They‚Äôre useful but best kept to essential paths only.

### ‚úÖ Strategies for Testing WPF Applications

- Follow the **MVVM pattern** to separate logic (Model & ViewModel) from UI (View).
- Keep UI code thin and avoid placing logic in code-behind files.
- Use **unit tests** for logic-heavy components.
- Use **UI automation tools** for verifying layout, control behavior, or user workflows.
- Handle exceptions and edge cases early in logic to reduce risk in UI.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

Testing WPF applications effectively means combining unit tests for internal logic and a small set of UI tests for end-to-end validation. The separation of concerns (e.g., using MVVM) and the use of frameworks like NUnit helped ensure reliability and maintainability in my application.
