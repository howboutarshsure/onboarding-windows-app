## 🧐 Research & Learn

### ✅ Risks of Using a Laptop Without External Accessories
- Poor posture due to looking down at the screen
- Neck and shoulder strain from a low monitor
- Wrist discomfort from typing on cramped laptop keyboards
- Eye strain from poor screen angles or lighting

### ✅ Ergonomic Equipment That Helps
- **Laptop stands** to raise screen height to eye level
- **External keyboards and mice** to maintain neutral wrist position
- **Adjustable ergonomic chairs** for better lumbar support
- **Footrests** for better leg alignment
- **Monitor arms** for customisable screen positioning

### ✅ Ideal Desk Setup
- Top of the screen at or just below eye level
- Elbows bent at 90 degrees when typing
- Feet flat on the ground or on a footrest
- Chair supports upright posture with back support
- Desk height allows forearms to rest comfortably

### ✅ Daily Habits to Reduce Discomfort
- Take movement or stretching breaks every 30–60 minutes
- Use the 20-20-20 rule for eye strain (every 20 mins, look 20 ft away for 20 secs)
- Sit upright with shoulders relaxed and back supported
- Blink often and adjust screen brightness to match the room
