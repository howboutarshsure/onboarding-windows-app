## ‚úÖ First-Time User Experience Assignment

### üì∏ Notes During Testing (Screenshots + Detailed Observations)

1. **Observation 1**: Account Creation Process
   - Description: The app asks for a lot of personal goals and routines upfront. It felt overwhelming without clear examples or a ‚Äúskip for now‚Äù option.
   - Screenshot: [Would show initial setup screen]

2. **Observation 2**: Routine Setup Confusion
   - Description: It wasn‚Äôt obvious how to set up or edit a routine after initially creating it. I expected an "Edit" button next to the routine name but had to dig into settings.
   - Screenshot: [Would show routines dashboard]

3. **Observation 3**: Default-Looking Text Boxes
   - Description: Some text boxes looked very basic and default, without much modern styling. A cleaner or more modern design could make the app feel more polished and welcoming.
   - Screenshot: [Would show an input screen]

4. **Observation 4**: Quitting the App
   - Description: You can‚Äôt quit the app easily by right-clicking the icon in the taskbar. Users expect to have options like "Quit" or "Exit" when right-clicking ‚Äî not having this could confuse or frustrate some users.
   - Screenshot: [Would show taskbar interaction]

5. **Observation 5**: Notifications and Blocking Features
   - Description: The first time it tried to block distracting apps, there wasn‚Äôt a very clear ‚Äúallow‚Äù prompt for permissions. It might confuse users who aren‚Äôt familiar with Windows app permissions.
   - Screenshot: [Would show permissions popup]

## ‚úÖ Reflection Questions

### What was your first impression of the app?

The app felt very user-focused and clearly designed to help with focus and routine building. It gave a sense of encouragement. However, it was also slightly overwhelming because of the number of questions and setup steps initially.

### Did you find anything difficult to understand?

Yes ‚Äî the purpose of certain modes and how routines linked to focus sessions wasn‚Äôt 100% clear without exploring deeper. Some of the language and lack of initial tooltips made it harder to fully understand at first glance.

### If you had to explain Focus Bear to a friend in one sentence, what would you say?

Focus Bear is a productivity app that helps you block distractions and stick to your habits through real-time guidance and structured daily routines.

### What are some changes that could improve the new user experience?

- Offer a quick start option with minimal setup, letting users customise later.
- Add tooltips or short tutorials explaining terms like "deep work mode."
- Update text box designs to look more modern and visually polished.
- Add an option to quit the app from the right-click taskbar menu.
- Provide clearer instructions during permission requests.
